const kDemandSideExpansionaryMonetaryPolicyDescription = '''
The central bank will take actions to increase the money supply.
This usually includes it buying bonds from commercial banks 
which increases their excess cash reserves which can be lent out to 
consumers and firms.
An increase in the money supply causes a lower equilibrium interest rate.
This encourages consumers to increase borrowing and spending 
and firms to borrow to invest in capital which causes an increase 
in aggregate demand.

The central bank will take actions to decrease the money supply.
This usually includes it selling bonds to commercial banks 
which decreases the excess cash reserves which can be lent out to

An decrease in the money supply causes a higher equilibrium interest rate.
This encourages consumers to decrease borrowing and spending 
and firms to reduce borrowing to invest in capital which causes an 
decrease in aggregate demand.

const kFixedRateCentralBankSellsDomesticCurrency = '''
A country fixes its interest rate at 0.95 units against another currency. 
Suppose the demand for a country's exports increases. This leads to 
an increased demand for the domestic currency (Fig. 1), 
creating a shortage of the currency in the foreign exchange market. The shortage places upward pressure 
on the exchange rate. In response, the central bank sells domestic currency 
and buys foreign currency (Fig. 2) to maintain the fixed exchange rate target.

A country fixes its interest rate at 0.95 units against another currency. 
Suppose there is lower demand for its exports, this causes demand to decrease (Fig. 1) creating a surplus of its currency
